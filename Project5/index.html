    <p>As a trinational individual with roots in Mali, Ivory Coast, and Senegal, I have recognized it as my responsibility to present my countries in a positive light and to educate those who may be unfamiliar with them. My connection with these nations began at a very early age. I first visited Bamako, Mali, when I was just three years old. Shortly thereafter, I traveled to Dakar, Senegal, where my grandfather resided. When I was six years old, I visited the Ivory Coast for the first time.

    <p>When I would mention my origins to people, I often noticed a perplexed expression on their faces. This indicated that they had not heard of the countries I was referencing. It wasn't until my adolescent years that I began to ponder why so many individuals lacked knowledge about Africa as a whole, particularly the countries I am from.

    </p>

    <p>A simple Google search for 'Mali' typically results in headlines related to poverty or conflict. Unfortunately, these negative narratives dominate the search results. This raises the question of why Western media fails to highlight the positive developments taking place in these countries. As someone who visits all three of these countries each year, I can attest that they are making significant progress beyond what is commonly portrayed.

    </p>

    <p>Senegal and Ivory Coast, for instance, are among the leading countries in Africa when it comes to technological advancements. These countries have reliable access to essential services such as water and electricity, showcasing their progress and potential. Africa is not a continent defined solely by poverty; it is a continent of diverse strengths and opportunities.
