        <h1>"Djelika's Biography"</h1>

    <body>
        I am an IMT major. I picked this major because I am interested in cyber security. I am a part of the National Association of black Accounts (NABA) and have a position as an ambassador and social media chair. I also completed a coding project in one of my classes, IST 256, in which I had to create a game. Outside of school, I like to surf, and I'm also interested in cosmetology. I aspire to become an information security manager while also being able to enjoy hobbies like surfing and braiding hair.
