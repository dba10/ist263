                Hello, my name is Abdoulaye Diop. I am a first-year student here at Syracuse University, majoring in <strong> Information Management & Technology </strong> and minoring in <strong>Accounting</strong>. One long term goal for me is to be an IT Consultant for a major Accounting firm.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the future, I am interested in providing IT (Information Technology) services for an accounting firm. I am an HEOP & Blumin Family Fellowship student here at SU. I love to play sports and video games. My favorite TV show is Prison Break. Fun fact, I am a first-generation college student, and I am the oldest of 4.

                When I am not in Syracuse, I am probably in my hometown, New York City. I love spending ample time with my family and friends as there is always so much to do in the city that never sleeps. Some things I can do is:
