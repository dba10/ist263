        In COVID, staying home and having a remote job allowed me to make my own money. As I grew into 
        maturity, I began to buy my own clothes and enhance my own fashion as I realized I shouldn't continue 
        to ask my parents for my clothes and shoes. My sneaker collection kicked off and I started to look into affordable designer clothing.

        The first outfit I put together is here: <br>

        At a young age, my parents dressed me up on Eid-Ul-Fitr. From decided to the color of the silk to the shoes I wore along with. In this time period of me expanding my fashion, I took it upon my self to be more creative and bring more variety to the colors of my bazins and match sneakers along with it.<br>
